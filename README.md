# Event Handler

In <code>src/components/App.js</code> we have a small form defined,
but there is a small problem, when we click on the button it submits the form which leads to the page being refreshed.

Solve this by adding appropriate event handler on <em>form</em> tag.

Also when user submits the form, print this to console "form submitted".
